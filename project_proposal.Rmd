## Executive Summary

## The Problem And Background

Rossmann is a Germany's second largest drug store chain and operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries.
Rossmann store managers are responsible for predicting the daily sales for stores for up to six weeks in advance.

With individual managers using their expertise and judgement to predict these sales the accruacy can have huge variance.

Rossman challenged data scientists on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) to predict 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany.

The main motivation behind developing a model to predict the sales is to off-load and automate some of the work from store managers so as to increase the productivity, manage staff schedules. A robust prediction model enables the store managers to focus on the customers and staff members.

The following factors can affect the store sales:

* promotions,
* competition,
* school and state holidays,
* seasonality, and
* locality.

## Objective

To build a model to Forecast sales using store, promotion, and competitor data

\pagebreak

## Approach

\pagebreak

## About the Data

[Source: Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data)

Historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores is provided.
The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set.

### Files

* __train.csv__ - historical data including Sales
* __test.csv__  - historical data excluding Sales
* __store.csv__ - supplemental information about the stores

### Data dictionary

* __Id__ - an Id that represents a (Store, Date) duple within the test set
* __Store__ - a unique Id for each store
* __Sales__ - the turnover for any given day (this is what you are predicting)
* __Customers__ - the number of customers on a given day
* __Open__ - an indicator for whether the store was open: 0 = closed, 1 = open
* __StateHoliday__ - indicates a state holiday. Normally all stores, with few exceptions, are closed on state holidays. Note that all schools are closed on public holidays and weekends. a = public holiday, b = Easter holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = None
* __SchoolHoliday__ - indicates if the (Store, Date) was affected by the closure of public schools
* __StoreType__ - differentiates between 4 different store models: a, b, c, d
* __Assortment__ - describes an assortment level: a = basic, b = extra, c = extended
* __CompetitionDistance__ - distance in meters to the nearest competitor store
* __CompetitionOpenSince [Month/Year]__ - gives the approximate year and month of the time the nearest competitor was opened
* __Promo__ - indicates whether a store is running a promo on that day
* __Promo2__ - Promo2 is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores: 0 = store is not participating, 1 = store is participating
* __Promo2Since [Year/Week]__ - describes the year and calendar week when the store started participating in Promo2
* __PromoInterval__ - describes the consecutive intervals Promo2 is started, naming the months the promotion is started anew. E.g. "Feb,May,Aug,Nov" means each round starts in February, May, August, November of any given year for that store

### Data reformatting

The CompetitionOpenSinceMonth and CompetitionOpenSinceYear variables in the rossman.store dataset are combined and parsed into Y-m-d date format. The new variable is called CompetitionStart and indicates the date on which a competing store to a Rossmann store opened.
Similarly, the Promo2SinceYear and Promo2SinceWeek variables are also combined and parsed into a valid date format to indicate the date when a store started participating in Promo2.

The unused variables, CompetitionOpenSinceMonth, CompetitionOpenSinceYear, Promo2SinceYear, Promo2SinceWeek are then removed from the dataset.

```{r}
rossman.train <-
  rossman.train %>%
  mutate(DayOfWeek = fct_recode(DayOfWeek,
                                "Monday" = "1" ,
                                "Tuesday" = "2" ,
                                "Wednesday" = "3" ,
                                "Thursday" = "4" ,
                                "Friday" = "5" ,
                                "Saturday" = "6" ,
                                "Sunday" = "7" ),
         Open = fct_recode(Open,
                           "Yes" = "1",
                           "No" = "0"),
         Promo = fct_recode(Promo,
                            "Yes" = "1",
                            "No" = "0"),
         StateHoliday = fct_recode(StateHoliday,
                                   "None" = "0",
                                   "Public" = "a",
                                   "Easter" = "b",
                                   "Christmas" = "c"),
         SchoolHoliday = fct_recode(SchoolHoliday,
                            "Yes" = "1",
                            "No" = "0"))

### Missing value and outliers

> "An explicit missing value is the presence of an absence; an implicit missing value is the absence of a presence" - Hadley Wickam

Two types of missing values:

__Explicit missing value__

Field | Missing Count
---|---
CompetitionDistance | `r sum(is.na(rossman.store$CompetitionDistance))`
CompetitionStart | `r sum(is.na(rossman.store$CompetitionStart))`
PromoSinceDate | `r sum(is.na(rossman.store$PromoSinceDate))`
PromoInterval | `r sum(is.na(rossman.store$PromoInterval))`

__Implicit missing value__

The number of stores that have recorded sales data falls significantly during a 6 month period. This information was provided in the data description as:

> Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

These are implicit missing values in the sense that there are no NAs present in the data set. Instead the expected rows are missing all together.

## Data Imputation

Field | Assumption/Observation | Handling
---|---|---
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
CompetitionDistance | There is no competition | Set to mean(CompetitionDistance)
CompetitionStart | Competition was already present | Set to min(month(date))
PromoSinceDate | NAs are seen only when Promo = No | Set to Zero
PromoInterval | NAs are seen only when Promo = No | Set to Zero
=======
CompetitionDistance | There is no competition | Set to max(CompetitionDistance)
CompetitionOpenSinceMonth | Competition was already present | Set to min(month(date))
Promo2SinceWeek | NAs are seen only when Promo = No | Set to Zero
Promo2SinceYear | NAs are seen only when Promo = No | Set to Zero
StateHoliday | NAs are seen when StateHoliday is not zero | Set to "Yes"

__Implicit Missing Values__

How to Fix this ?

We can use some simple rules to __create__ missing values,

* Create a row for every (Store, Date) for the missing six months
* DayOfWeek - can be created using Date
* Open - take a majority vote to decide if store is open on the date
* Promo - take a majority vote to decide if store is running a promo on the date
* StateHoliday - take a majority vote to decide if there is a state holiday on the date
* SchoolHoliday - take a majority vote to decide if there is a school holiday on the date
* Sales - take mean(Sales)
* Customers - take mean(Customers)

## EDA
Let's explore the variables that describe the 1115 Rossman stores.
The store are categorized into 4 types: a, b, c and d. The number of stores of each type are as follows:

```{r fig.width=10}
table(rossman.store$StoreType)
merged.rossman.train %>%
  group_by(StoreType) %>%
  summarize(avgSalePerCustomer = round(mean(Sales/Customers, na.rm = T), 2),
            avgSales = round(mean(Sales), 2),
            avgCustomers = round(mean(Customers), 2)) %>%
  gather(key = "Metric", value = "value", avgSales, avgSalePerCustomer, avgCustomers) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = StoreType,
                         y = value,
                         fill = StoreType),
           stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge",
           width = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Store Type",
       y = "Value",
       title = "Exploring sales by Store Type") +
  facet_wrap(~ Metric, nrow = 1, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```

Each store has an assortment level which describes the amount of products offered by that store. The assortment levels are as described as follows:
a = basic, b = extra, c = extended  
Lets look at the number of stores corresponsing to each assortment level:

```{r, fig.width = 10}
table(rossman.store$Assortment)
merged.rossman.train %>%
  group_by(Assortment) %>%
  summarize(avgSalePerCustomer = round(mean(Sales/Customers, na.rm = T), 2),
            avgSales = round(mean(Sales), 2),
            avgCustomers = round(mean(Customers), 2)) %>%
  gather(key = "Metric", value = "value", avgSales, avgSalePerCustomer, avgCustomers) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Assortment,
                         y = value,
                         fill = Assortment),
           stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge",
           width = 0.4) +
  labs(x = "Assortment",
       y = "Value",
       title = "Exploring sales by Assortment") +
  facet_wrap(~ Metric, nrow = 1, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```

Further, lets explore the assortment levels under each store type:

```{r}
table(rossman.store$StoreType, rossman.store$Assortment, dnn = c("Store Type", "Assortment level"))
```
The distance of each store from a nearest competing store has been provided in the dataset. Lets check the distribution of this variable.
```{r}
ggplot(rossman.store) + geom_histogram(aes(x=CompetitionDistance), binwidth = 10000)
ggplot(rossman.store) + geom_boxplot(aes(y=CompetitionDistance, x=""))
```

The plots indicates that the variable CompetitionDistance is right skewed and contains a large number of outliers.
We can further breakdown the variable and explore it separately for each StoreType.

```{r}
ggplot(rossman.store) + geom_boxplot(aes(y=CompetitionDistance, x=StoreType))

```

The above plot indicates that most of the outliers are noticed for store type 'a'

Promo2 is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores: 0 = store is not participating, 1 = store is participating.
Lets look at how many store are offering the promotion

```{r}
rossman.store %>% 
  select(Promo2) %>% 
  group_by(Promo2) %>% 
  summarize(total = n()) %>% 
ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x=Promo2, y=total), stat = "identity")
```

Further, the variable PromoInterval describes the consecutive intervals Promo2 is started, naming the months the promotion is started anew. E.g. "Feb,May,Aug,Nov" means each round starts in February, May, August, November of any given year for that store

Lets look at the distribution of Promo2 participating stores based on the PromotionInterval:

```{r}
table(rossman.store$Promo2, rossman.store$PromoInterval)
```

## Models

\pagebreak

## Evaluation Criteria

The Kaggle competition used Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) as the evaluation metric and we will be using the same metric for evaluating the predictive performance of our model.
The RMSPE is calculated as

![](img/rmspe.png)

where 

$y_{i}$ denotes the sales of a single store on a single day
$yhat_{i}$ denotes the corresponding prediction.

__Note: Any day and store with 0 sales is ignored in scoring.__
