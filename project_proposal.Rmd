## The Problem And Background

Rossmann is a Germany's second largest drug store chain and operates over 3,000 drug stores in 7 European countries.
Rossmann store managers are responsible for predicting the daily sales for stores for up to six weeks in advance.

With individual managers using their expertise and judgement to predict these sales the accruacy can have huge variance.

Rossman challenged data scientists on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales) to predict 6 weeks of daily sales for 1,115 stores located across Germany.

The main motivation behind developing a model to predict the sales is to off-load and automate some of the work from store managers so as to increase the productivity, manage staff schedules. A robust prediction model enables the store managers to focus on the customers and staff members.

The following factors can affect the store sales:

* promotions,
* competition,
* school and state holidays,
* seasonality, and
* locality.

## Objective

To build a model to Forecast sales using store, promotion, and competitor data

\pagebreak

## Approach

First step is to merge the training dataset and Store Sales data set. After that we will check each variable for missing values, clean the data and will do the required imputations. Our next step will be Exploratory Data Analysis where we identify variables that are important for building a forecasting model.

The crucial part of the project is that the data in hand is a time series data. The problem with the data, as observed, is that there is a 6 month gap, where only a few stores report their revenues because the other stores were temporarily closed for refurbishment, which hampers the seasonality of the data. We will deal with this by imputing sales figures during the renovation period to have a complete time series of 942 days as with other stores that did not undergo renovation. Then using Random Forest for variable selection and Forecasting Package in R, we will build a model that best fits the data and has a high predictive accuracy.

## About the Data

[Source: Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales/data)

Historical sales data for 1,115 Rossmann stores is provided.
The task is to forecast the "Sales" column for the test set.

### Files

* __train.csv__ - historical data including Sales
* __test.csv__  - historical data excluding Sales
* __store.csv__ - supplemental information about the stores

### Data dictionary

* __Id__ - an Id that represents a (Store, Date) duple within the test set
* __Store__ - a unique Id for each store
* __Sales__ - the turnover for any given day (this is what you are predicting)
* __Customers__ - the number of customers on a given day
* __Open__ - an indicator for whether the store was open: 0 = closed, 1 = open
* __StateHoliday__ - indicates a state holiday. Normally all stores, with few exceptions, are closed on state holidays. Note that all schools are closed on public holidays and weekends. a = public holiday, b = Easter holiday, c = Christmas, 0 = None
* __SchoolHoliday__ - indicates if the (Store, Date) was affected by the closure of public schools
* __StoreType__ - differentiates between 4 different store models: a, b, c, d
* __Assortment__ - describes an assortment level: a = basic, b = extra, c = extended
* __CompetitionDistance__ - distance in meters to the nearest competitor store
* __CompetitionOpenSince [Month/Year]__ - gives the approximate year and month of the time the nearest competitor was opened
* __Promo__ - indicates whether a store is running a promo on that day
* __Promo2__ - Promo2 is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores: 0 = store is not participating, 1 = store is participating
* __Promo2Since [Year/Week]__ - describes the year and calendar week when the store started participating in Promo2
* __PromoInterval__ - describes the consecutive intervals Promo2 is started, naming the months the promotion is started anew. E.g. "Feb,May,Aug,Nov" means each round starts in February, May, August, November of any given year for that store

\pagebreak

### Data reformatting

* Conversion of formats
* Recoding levels for factor variables

```{r}
rossman.train <-
  rossman.train %>%
  mutate(DayOfWeek = fct_recode(DayOfWeek,
                                "Monday" = "1" ,
                                "Tuesday" = "2" ,
                                "Wednesday" = "3" ,
                                "Thursday" = "4" ,
                                "Friday" = "5" ,
                                "Saturday" = "6" ,
                                "Sunday" = "7" ),
         Open = fct_recode(Open,
                           "Yes" = "1",
                           "No" = "0"),
         Promo = fct_recode(Promo,
                            "Yes" = "1",
                            "No" = "0"),
         StateHoliday = fct_recode(StateHoliday,
                                   "None" = "0",
                                   "Public" = "a",
                                   "Easter" = "b",
                                   "Christmas" = "c"),
         SchoolHoliday = fct_recode(SchoolHoliday,
                            "Yes" = "1",
                            "No" = "0"))
```

### Combining Variables
  
* The CompetitionOpenSinceMonth and CompetitionOpenSinceYear variables in the rossman.store dataset are combined and parsed into Y-m-d date format. The new variable is called CompetitionStart and indicates the date on which a competing store to a Rossmann store opened.
* Similarly, the Promo2SinceYear and Promo2SinceWeek variables are also combined and parsed into a valid date format to indicate the date when a store started participating in Promo2.
* The unused variables, CompetitionOpenSinceMonth, CompetitionOpenSinceYear, Promo2SinceYear, Promo2SinceWeek are then removed from the dataset.

### Missing value and outliers

> "An explicit missing value is the presence of an absence; an implicit missing value is the absence of a presence" - Hadley Wickam

Two types of missing values:

__Explicit missing value__

Field | Missing Count
---|---
CompetitionDistance | `r sum(is.na(rossman.store$CompetitionDistance))`
CompetitionStart | `r sum(is.na(rossman.store$CompetitionStart))`
PromoSinceDate | `r sum(is.na(rossman.store$PromoSinceDate))`
PromoInterval | `r sum(is.na(rossman.store$PromoInterval))`

__Implicit missing value__

The number of stores that have recorded sales data falls significantly during a 6 month period. This information was provided in the data description as:

> Note that some stores in the dataset were temporarily closed for refurbishment.

These are implicit missing values in the sense that there are no NAs present in the data set. Instead the expected rows are missing all together.

## Data Imputation

Field | Assumption/Observation | Handling
---|---|---
CompetitionDistance | No competition | Set to mean
CompetitionStart | Already present | Set to min date
PromoSinceDate | NAs only when Promo = No | Set to Zero
PromoInterval | NAs only when Promo = No | Set to Zero

__Implicit Missing Values__

How to Fix this ?

We can use some simple rules to __create__ missing values,

* Create a row for every (Store, Date) for the missing six months
* DayOfWeek - can be created using Date
* Open - take a majority vote to decide if store is open on the date
* Promo - take a majority vote to decide if store is running a promo on the date
* StateHoliday - take a majority vote to decide if there is a state holiday on the date
* SchoolHoliday - take a majority vote to decide if there is a school holiday on the date
* Sales - take mean(Sales)
* Customers - take mean(Customers)

```{r}
# Merge store data into the sales data

merged.rossman.train <-
  rossman.train %>%
  left_join(rossman.store, by = 'Store')

# Drop in number of stores during a 6 month period

merged.rossman.train %>% 
  group_by(Date) %>% 
  summarize(n = n()) %>% 
  ggplot() +
    geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Date,
                            y = n),
              color = "#3498db") +
    labs(x = "Date",
         y = "Number of stores",
         title = "Number of stores open across time")

```

Let us look at the store sales for one of the stores that is missing data during this period.

```{r}
merged.rossman.train %>%
  filter(Store == 20) %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Date,
                       y = Sales)) +
  geom_line(color = "#2ecc71") +
  geom_smooth() + 
  labs(title = "Store 20 Revenue across time")
```

We can use some simple rules to __create__ data for missing values,

* Create a row for every (Store, Date) for the missing six months
* DayOfWeek - can be created using Date
* Open - take a majority vote to decide if store is open on the date
* Promo - take a majority vote to decide if store is running a promo on the date
* StateHoliday - take a majority vote to decide if there is a state holiday on the date
* SchoolHoliday - take a majority vote to decide if there is a school holiday on the date
* Sales - take mean(Sales)
* Customers - take mean(Customers)

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Let's explore the variables that describe the 1115 Rossman stores.
The store are categorized into 4 types: a, b, c and d. The number of stores of each type are as follows:

```{r, fig.width=10, include = T}
kable(as.data.frame(table(rossman.store$StoreType)), col.names = c("Store Type", "Frequency"))
```

```{r, fig.width=10, include = T}
merged.rossman.train %>%
  group_by(StoreType) %>%
  summarize(avgSalePerCustomer = round(mean(Sales/Customers, na.rm = T), 2),
            avgSales = round(mean(Sales), 2),
            avgCustomers = round(mean(Customers), 2)) %>%
  gather(key = "Metric", value = "value", avgSales, avgSalePerCustomer, avgCustomers) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = StoreType,
                         y = value,
                         fill = StoreType),
           stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge",
           width = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Store Type",
       y = "Value",
       title = "Exploring sales by Store Type") +
  facet_wrap(~ Metric, nrow = 1, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```

Each store has an assortment level which describes the amount of products offered by that store. The assortment levels are as described as follows:
a = basic, b = extra, c = extended  
Lets look at the number of stores corresponsing to each assortment level:

```{r, fig.width = 10}
kable(as.data.frame(table(rossman.store$Assortment)),
      col.names = c("Assortment", "Frequency"))
merged.rossman.train %>%
  group_by(Assortment) %>%
  summarize(avgSalePerCustomer = round(mean(Sales/Customers, na.rm = T), 2),
            avgSales = round(mean(Sales), 2),
            avgCustomers = round(mean(Customers), 2)) %>%
  gather(key = "Metric", value = "value", avgSales, avgSalePerCustomer, avgCustomers) %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = Assortment,
                         y = value,
                         fill = Assortment),
           stat = "identity",
           position = "dodge",
           width = 0.4) +
  labs(x = "Assortment",
       y = "Value",
       title = "Exploring sales by Assortment") +
  facet_wrap(~ Metric, nrow = 1, scales = "free") +
  coord_flip()
```

Further, lets explore the assortment levels under each store type:

```{r}
table(rossman.store$StoreType, rossman.store$Assortment, dnn = c("Store Type", "Assortment level"))
```

The distance of each store from a nearest competing store has been provided in the dataset. Lets check the distribution of this variable.

```{r}

  ggplot(rossman.store) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x=CompetitionDistance),
                 binwidth = 10000,
                 fill = "#c0392b") +
  labs(x = "Competition Distance",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of Competition Distance")

  ggplot(rossman.store) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(y=CompetitionDistance,
                     x=""),
                 fill = "#c0392b") +
    labs(y = "Competition Distance",
       x = "",
       title = "Distribution of Competition Distance (Boxplot)")
```

The plots indicates that the variable CompetitionDistance is right skewed and contains a large number of outliers.

Let us try the log transformation for this variable

```{r}
  ggplot(rossman.store) + 
  geom_histogram(aes(x=log(CompetitionDistance)),
                 binwidth = 1,
                 fill = "#2980b9")  +
  labs(x = "log(Competition Distance)",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Distribution of Log of Competition Distance")

  ggplot(rossman.store) +
    geom_boxplot(aes(y=log(CompetitionDistance),
                     x=""),
                 fill = "#2980b9")  +
    labs(y = "log(Competition Distance)",
       x = "",
       title = "Distribution of Log of Competition Distance (Boxplot)")
```

We can further breakdown the variable and explore it separately for each StoreType.

```{r}
  ggplot(rossman.store) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(y = log(CompetitionDistance),
                   x = StoreType,
                   fill = StoreType))   +
    labs(y = "log(Competition Distance)",
       x = "Store Type",
       title = "Distribution of Log of Competition Distance (Boxplot)")

```

Very few outliers are seen after the log transformation.

Promo2 is a continuing and consecutive promotion for some stores: 0 = store is not participating, 1 = store is participating.
Lets look at how many store are offering the promotion

```{r}
rossman.store %>% 
  select(Promo2) %>% 
  group_by(Promo2) %>% 
  summarize(total = n()) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_bar(aes(x=Promo2,
               y=total,
               fill = Promo2),
           stat = "identity") +
    labs(y = "Number of stores",
         x = "Promotion",
         title = "Promotion running stores")
```

Further, the variable PromoInterval describes the consecutive intervals Promo2 is started, naming the months the promotion is started anew. E.g. "Feb,May,Aug,Nov" means each round starts in February, May, August, November of any given year for that store

Lets look at the distribution of Promo2 participating stores based on the PromotionInterval:

```{r}
kable(as.data.frame(table(rossman.store$Promo2, rossman.store$PromoInterval)) %>%
  filter(Var1 == 1) %>%
  select(c(Var2, Freq)),
  col.names = c("Promotion Interval", "Frequency"))
```

Variables Open, StateHoliday, and SchoolHoliday are categorical variables. The Variable open has values 1 and 0, which indicate whether the store was open (1) or closed (0).
Frequency of open and closed status for stores are shown below:

```{r}

# Imputing values and converting to factors

merged.rossman.train$StateHoliday[is.na(merged.rossman.train$StateHoliday)] <- 1

merged.rossman.train <- merged.rossman.train %>% mutate(Open = as.factor(Open),
                                          StateHoliday = as.factor(StateHoliday),
                                          SchoolHoliday = as.factor(SchoolHoliday))

kable(as.data.frame(table(merged.rossman.train$Open)),
      col.names = c("Store Open", "Frequency"))
```

Further, we can also check the status for each store type.

```{r}
table(merged.rossman.train$StoreType, merged.rossman.train$Open, dnn = c("Store Type",
      "Store Status"))
```

For Variable StateHoliday, a = Public Holiday, b = Easter Holiday, c = Christmas and 0 = no hoiday.

```{r}
kable(as.data.frame(table(merged.rossman.train$StateHoliday)),
      col.names = c("School Holiday", "Frequency"))
```


SchoolHoliday is similar to StateHoliday, 0 indicating that there was no schoolHoliday while 1 indicating that there was a SchoolHoliday

```{r}
kable(as.data.frame(table(merged.rossman.train$SchoolHoliday)),
      col.names = c("School Holiday", "Frequency"))
```

\pagebreak

## Models

The aim of modeling on the Rossmann Stores data is to predict the daily sales of stores for upto 6 weeks.
The primary models we would use for this purpose are __Regression Trees__ and __Random Forests__.  
A tree based model involves segmenting the predictor space into simpler regions. The prediction of a new observation is nothing but the mean of the observations which belong to the same region.  
However, tree based models do not provide as accurate predictions as other supervised learning methods. Hence, we would use the the Random forest technique, which involves producing multiple trees which are later combined to form a single prediction, to improve the prediction accuracy.

Additionally, we would explore the application of __Neural Networks__ to the data and compare the prediction accuracy to the Regression Tree and Random Forest Models.

If time allows, we would also like to use the 'forecast' package in R to predict the sales using a forecast model.

\pagebreak

## Evaluation Criteria

The Kaggle competition used Root Mean Square Percentage Error (RMSPE) as the evaluation metric and we will be using the same metric for evaluating the predictive performance of our model.
The RMSPE is calculated as

![](img/rmspe.png)

where 

$y_{i}$ denotes the sales of a single store on a single day
$yhat_{i}$ denotes the corresponding prediction.

__Note: Any day and store with 0 sales is ignored in scoring.__
